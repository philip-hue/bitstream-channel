;; Title: BitStream Channels - Bitcoin-Native Payment Channels on Stacks L2
;;
;; Summary: Secure, bidirectional payment channels enabling instant off-chain transactions with Bitcoin-final settlement
;;
;; Description: Implements non-custodial payment channels leveraging Stacks' Bitcoin-anchored security for trustless 
;; off-chain transactions. Enables unlimited micropayments with sub-second finality while settling net balances on 
;; Bitcoin-secured L2. Features: 1) Bitcoin-compatible multisig enforcement 2) Dispute resolution using Bitcoin block 
;; timestamps 3) STX-denominated channels with BTC-settlement compatibility 4) Optimized for Stacks' Clarity language 
;; security. Supports cooperative closures (instant settlement) and unilateral closures with 1-week Bitcoin-block-based 
;; challenge periods.
